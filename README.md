# 🦀 Rust Algorithms & Data Structures

A collection of efficient, idiomatic Rust solutions to algorithmic problems and data structure implementations. These solutions are gathered from various coding platforms such as LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeWars, and AdventOfCode.

The goal of this repository is not just to solve the problem, but to solve it using **idiomatic Rust**, leveraging safe concurrency, pattern matching, and zero-cost abstractions where possible.
